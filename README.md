# Code Supporting "Economic Damages from Hurricane Sandy Attributable to Sea Level Rise Caused by Anthropogenic Climate Change" by Strauss et al. (2020)
 
This repository contains the code to compute much of the analysis presented in "Economic Damages from Hurricane Sandy Attributable to Sea Level Rise Caused by Anthropogenic Climate Change", which is currently under consideration for publication at *Nature Communications* (updated Dec. 2020).

If you have any questions, comments, or feedback on this code, please [contact Daniel Gilford (Climate Central)](mailto:dgilford@climatecentral.org) or open an [Issue](https://github.com/climatecentral/cc_sandy_matlab/issues) in the repository.

## Citation

This study has been submitted to Nature Communications for consideration.

## Data

The data supporting (and in some cases output by) these analyses is archived at Zenodo with the doi:

<a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4302598"><img src="https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.4302598.svg" alt="DOI"></a>

The code expects this data, which includes simulation water height fields, semi-empirical model analyses, and observations. If you are running these analyses yourself, please download the data and update the appropriate filepaths in the codes you are running/referencing.

## Functionality

Importantly, this repository includes the code to load and correct the ADCIRC simulations. To do this correction, run the scripts in order:

WarpSandy()

SandyCorrectionError()

This will load the table "sandyObservationData," and build the "sandyWarpedModelCompleteData" matrix variable, which contains latitude and longitude in the first two columns, and the corrected max water heights for simulations alt01-alt09 (alt06 being historical) in the remaining columns.

Errors can be assessed using the script:

EvaluateSandyError( sandyObservationData, sandyWarpedModelCompleteData, 9 )

This does not include data nor code to compute exposure of any variable, as these are part of Climate Central's proprietary analysis systems, which due to licensing restrictions, cannot be shared.
